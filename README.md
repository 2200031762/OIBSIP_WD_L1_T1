## Multi-Page Landing Website - Task 01 of Level 1

I am excited to share my completed project for Task 01 of Level 1 in my web development journey with Oasis Infobyte!

This project involved creating a multi-page landing website using foundational HTML and CSS skills. The site includes separate pages for Home, Product, About Us, and Contact, each interconnected for seamless navigation.

### Key Features:
- **HTML:** Used semantic elements to structure content clearly and accessibly across multiple pages.
- **CSS:** Applied styling to ensure visual appeal, with careful attention to alignment, padding, and color palette, ensuring no overlapping of elements.
- **JavaScript:** Utilized for smooth navigation and dynamic content loading across pages.

### Project Highlights:
- **Multi-Page Navigation:** Ensured smooth transitions between Home, Product, About Us, and Contact pages.
- **Design and Layout:** Focused on creating a cohesive and professional look by meticulously arranging elements and sections.
- **Responsiveness:** Ensured the website is responsive and user-friendly across different devices and screen sizes.
